# K-Means-Clustering-using-Weka
Implemented k-means clustering algorithm in WEKA to find clusters in the unsupervised data using the two different formula for the calculation of intra cluster distances-Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance.
Implemented rule mining in WEKA using Apriori principle with two metrics- confidence and lift.
